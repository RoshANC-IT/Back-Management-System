**GitHub/Resume Description:**

A simple **Bank Management System** built in Java that supports basic banking operations such as account creation, balance inquiry, deposits, and withdrawals. The system uses serialization to persist account data between sessions. It features basic security with PIN-based authentication for transactions and handles exceptions for invalid inputs. This project demonstrates the use of object-oriented principles, file handling with serialization, and basic data management in a console-based application.
